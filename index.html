        <p>After graduating from university, I had to think about which field I wanted to enter into. Although I really
          enjoyed the logical side of my degree, I wanted to have a career in something which also incorporated creative
          and dynamic elements. As a logical thinker with a keen interest in innovation and technology, I realised that
          software engineering is a field that matches all of these criteria. The more I looked into this sector, the
          more excited I became about pursuing a job in it; I therefore decided to complete the Software Engineering
          Immersive course at General Assembly in order to make this a reality.
          <br /> <br />
          During the course I learned the necessary skills and technologies needed to develop full-stack web
          applications. This included MERN Stack development with RESTful APIâ€™s and back-end development using Django
          and Python. The course was 12 weeks long and involved lab-challenges, homework, paired programming and four
          group or solo projects.
          <br /> <br />
          With experience gained from my degree in Human Biology to working as a cheesemaker to studying full-stack
          software development at General assembly, I am no stranger to new situations and challenges. I am always
          looking forward to new chances to expand my knowledge base and skillsets. I now look forward to be able do
          this within the industry as a Junior Developer.
